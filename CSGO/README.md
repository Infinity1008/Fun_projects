I have been playing CS for 11 years now. 

It would be fair to say that this thing has taken a lot of time off my plate but nevertheless the memories it has given me throughout this time has been priceless and i would not exchange it for the world.

Given all this time playing, making a map was always on my bucket list. 

So here we are. The very first draft of my CSGO map. I will make more sophisticated maps later on, but for now this is a good start.

# The Map
The map is named **PvP Infinity** and can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851552237). If you want the source file of the map, it is uploaded to this repo with the name "de_infinity.bsp". 

You can use this to edit and create a new version of this map. Keep in mind that you will have to create the nav_mesh again for the bots to work.

It is suitable for a 1v1 or 2v2 game.

If you have any queries or want to suggest some changes feel free. 

# How it was made
You will need the CSGO source SDK that you can directly install from [steam](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Authoring_Tools). 

That will give you access to the hammer world editor

With the Hammer world editor, you will be able to create levels or maps according to your liking.

You can save your project and upload the map directly to the steamwork shop using csgo console for the whole world to play !
